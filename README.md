# SQL-Portfolio-Projects
Included in this repository is an example of my data analysis work utilizing SQL. The work showcases my experience in querying with 
Querying, Aggregatation, Joins.

The tools utilized were Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS), SQL, Python, and Jupyter Notebook.

(Note: I am actively working on improving my proficiency in CTEs, Functions, and DML within SQL)
